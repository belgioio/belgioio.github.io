I am an **Assistant Professor** at the **Division of Decision and Control Systems (DCS)** at **KTH Royal Institute of Technology**, Sweden. I am also a **Digital Futures Fellow** and a faculty member of the **Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)**. Prior to joining KTH, I was a Postdoc (first) and Senior Scientist (then) at the **Automatic Control Laboratory (ifA) at ETH Zurich**, Switzerland. 

**My research** is primarily focused on the interplay of **automatic control, optimization, and game theory with applications to complex systems**, especially large-scale infrastructures such as electrical power grids and transportation networks.
