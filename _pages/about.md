### About me

I am an Assistant Professor at the Division of Decision and Control Systems (DCS) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. I am also a Digital Futures Fellow and a Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) Faculty.

Previously, I was a Senior Scientist at the Automatic Control Laboratory (ifA) at ETH Zurich, and an affiliated researcher at the National Centre of Competence in Research on Dependable, Ubiquitous (NCCR) Automation in Zurich, Switzerland.  

### My research

My research is primarily focused on the interplay of automatic control, optimization, and game theory with applications to complex systems, especially large-scale infrastructures such as electrical power grids and transportation networks.
My ultimate goal is to improve their efficiency, reliability, and fairness by:

1. Designing novel algorithms inspired by optimization and game theory;

2. Developing a solid theoretical framework to certify their reliability and fairness;

3. Driving technological advancements via industry collaborations.
