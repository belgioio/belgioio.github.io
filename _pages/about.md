### About me

I am an Assistant Professor at the Division of Decision and Control Systems (DCS) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. I am also a Digital Futures Fellow and a faculty member of the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP). Prior to joining KTH, I was a Senior Scientist at the Automatic Control Laboratory (ifA) at ETH Zurich in Switzerland. 

### My research

My research is primarily focused on the interplay of automatic control, optimization, and game theory with applications to complex systems, especially large-scale infrastructures such as electrical power grids and transportation networks.
My ultimate goal is to improve their efficiency, reliability, and fairness by:

1. Designing novel algorithms inspired by optimization and game theory;

2. Developing a solid theoretical framework to certify their reliability and fairness;

3. Driving technological advancements through their integration into the wild.
